Quick note about the logic behind pagination & search:
- All items available to user has a match-class.
- The pagination handles all items with this class, and ignores the rest.
- All items get the class on startup, as in all items are "matched".
- Items that don't match search has this class removed.
This solves the problem of pagination within search.
